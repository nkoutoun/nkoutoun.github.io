abstract: Using granular bank transaction data from a major Belgian bank, we analyze the heterogeneous impact of COVID-19 on household consumption patterns. Our dataset covers over 200,000 households during the pandemic period, allowing us to examine consumption responses across different demographic groups and spending categories. We find significant heterogeneity in consumption responses, with younger households and those in contact-intensive sectors showing larger declines. The analysis reveals important insights for understanding the economic effects of pandemic-related restrictions and the design of targeted policy responses.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper uses detailed bank transaction data to examine how COVID-19 affected household consumption patterns, revealing significant heterogeneity across demographic groups.

This research provides novel insights into the heterogeneous economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic using granular household-level transaction data. The findings have important implications for understanding crisis responses and designing targeted policy interventions.

## Key Findings

1. **Heterogeneous Responses**: Consumption impacts varied significantly across demographic groups
2. **Sectoral Differences**: Contact-intensive sectors experienced larger declines
3. **Age Effects**: Younger households showed more pronounced consumption reductions
4. **Policy Implications**: Results inform targeted support measure design

## Data and Methodology

The analysis leverages a unique dataset from a major Belgian bank covering:
- Over 200,000 households
- Detailed transaction-level data
- Full pandemic period coverage
- Granular spending category information
