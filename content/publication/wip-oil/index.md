abstract: This paper examines how global oil price shocks affect the US economy, with particular attention to the heterogeneous effects across states based on their shale oil production levels. We analyze how the shale oil revolution has altered the transmission of oil price shocks to regional economic activity and explore the implications for aggregate economic responses.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Analysis of how oil price shocks affect the US economy heterogeneously based on cross-state differences in shale oil production.

This research investigates how the shale oil revolution has fundamentally changed the way oil price shocks transmit through the US economy, creating new patterns of regional heterogeneity based on local energy production capabilities.

## Research Focus

The paper addresses several key questions:

1. **Regional Heterogeneity**: How do oil price effects vary across US states based on shale production?
2. **Transmission Mechanisms**: What are the channels through which oil prices affect regional economies?
3. **Structural Change**: How has the shale revolution altered traditional oil-economy relationships?
4. **Aggregate Implications**: What do regional differences mean for national economic responses?

## Methodology

- **Data**: State-level economic indicators and shale oil production data
- **Approach**: Panel data analysis exploiting cross-state variation in shale resources
- **Period**: Focus on pre- and post-shale boom periods
- **Identification**: Leveraging exogenous variation in geological shale deposits

## Key Contributions

1. **Novel Perspective**: First comprehensive analysis of shale oil's role in oil shock transmission
2. **Regional Focus**: Detailed examination of cross-state heterogeneity
3. **Policy Relevance**: Insights for energy and macroeconomic policy
4. **Empirical Innovation**: New approaches to measuring regional energy effects
