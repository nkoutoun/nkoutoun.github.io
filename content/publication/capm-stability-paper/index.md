abstract: This study examines the stability of the CAPM before and after the recent global financial crisis in the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE). Firms' betas are derived from OLS and M-estimation regressions. Fixed and random effects are employed to estimate the linear and the nonlinear version of the CAPM. Evidence against a stable beta emerges after the crisis but not before. The latter holds for the non-linear paradigm as well.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study examines CAPM stability before and after the 2008 financial crisis using data from the Johannesburg Securities Exchange, finding evidence of beta instability post-crisis.

This study contributes to the literature on asset pricing models and their stability during financial crises, with a focus on emerging markets.

## Key Findings

1. **Pre-Crisis Stability**: CAPM betas were stable before the 2008 financial crisis
2. **Post-Crisis Instability**: Evidence of beta instability emerges after the crisis
3. **Nonlinear Effects**: The instability holds for both linear and nonlinear versions of CAPM
4. **Emerging Market Context**: Results specific to the South African market (JSE)

## Methodology

The study employs panel data techniques including:
- Fixed and random effects estimation
- OLS and M-estimation for beta calculation
- Linear and nonlinear CAPM specifications
- Pre- and post-crisis sample analysis

**Keywords:** Panel data; CAPM; South Africa; Global financial crisis
