abstract: We examine how household debt portfolios, aggregated to the ZIP code level, respond to local income shocks. Using a Bartik-style instrument for persistent income changes and a novel instrument based on shale oil discoveries for transitory shocks, we document that households, on aggregate, use positive income shocks to pay down debt. However, this aggregate response masks a stark bifurcation in financial strategy. The main point of consensus is high-interest credit card debt, which nearly all households prioritize repaying, but the divergence is most pronounced for mortgages and auto loans. Specifically, the deleveraging of total credit is driven by financially healthier households—those with high credit scores, high incomes, or low leverage—who aggressively target consumer debt via credit cards and auto loans. In contrast, financially constrained households often use the income windfall as a gateway to new auto credit, while simultaneously showing a strong propensity to pay down their largest liability, the mortgage. Our findings highlight that an income shock triggers balance-sheet repair for some and relaxes borrowing constraints for others, calling for more nuanced policy approaches that account for this deep heterogeneity.

<!-- This research investigates how different types of households respond to income changes through their credit behavior, providing new insights into the transmission mechanisms of economic shocks and their implications for financial stability and monetary policy effectiveness.

## Key Research Questions

1. **Heterogeneity**: How do household characteristics influence credit responses to income shocks?
2. **Mechanisms**: What are the underlying mechanisms driving these differential responses?
3. **Policy Implications**: How do these findings inform financial stability and monetary policy?

## Methodology

- **Data**: Household-level credit and income data
- **Approach**: Empirical analysis of credit adjustment patterns
- **Period**: Recent years covering various economic conditions
- **Sample**: Comprehensive household sample with detailed characteristics

## Preliminary Findings

The analysis reveals significant heterogeneity in how households adjust their credit usage in response to income shocks, with important implications for understanding financial stability and the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. -->
