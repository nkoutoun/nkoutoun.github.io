{{% /callout %}}

This research investigates how different types of households respond to income changes through their credit behavior, providing new insights into the transmission mechanisms of economic shocks and their implications for financial stability and monetary policy effectiveness.

## Key Research Questions

1. **Heterogeneity**: How do household characteristics influence credit responses to income shocks?
2. **Mechanisms**: What are the underlying mechanisms driving these differential responses?
3. **Policy Implications**: How do these findings inform financial stability and monetary policy?

## Methodology

- **Data**: Household-level credit and income data
- **Approach**: Empirical analysis of credit adjustment patterns
- **Period**: Recent years covering various economic conditions
- **Sample**: Comprehensive household sample with detailed characteristics

## Preliminary Findings

The analysis reveals significant heterogeneity in how households adjust their credit usage in response to income shocks, with important implications for understanding financial stability and the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission.
