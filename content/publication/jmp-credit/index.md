abstract: We examine the effect of local income shocks on households' debt portfolios aggregated to the zip code level. Households with stronger credit standing and lower leverage actively deleverage across multiple products, whereas some more vulnerable groups expand auto borrowing despite reducing other types of debt. These findings highlight balance-sheet repair, rather than spending, as a priority even among those with few resources.  By highlighting the varied ways different households and credit products respond to shifts in income, our study calls for more nuanced policy approaches that account for heterogeneity in both borrower characteristics and debt composition.

<!-- This research investigates how different types of households respond to income changes through their credit behavior, providing new insights into the transmission mechanisms of economic shocks and their implications for financial stability and monetary policy effectiveness.

## Key Research Questions

1. **Heterogeneity**: How do household characteristics influence credit responses to income shocks?
2. **Mechanisms**: What are the underlying mechanisms driving these differential responses?
3. **Policy Implications**: How do these findings inform financial stability and monetary policy?

## Methodology

- **Data**: Household-level credit and income data
- **Approach**: Empirical analysis of credit adjustment patterns
- **Period**: Recent years covering various economic conditions
- **Sample**: Comprehensive household sample with detailed characteristics

## Preliminary Findings

The analysis reveals significant heterogeneity in how households adjust their credit usage in response to income shocks, with important implications for understanding financial stability and the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. -->
