abstract: The transmission of the pandemic shock to the macroeconomy through the prism of consumer heterogeneity is the focal point of this paper. Based on a rich bank account and transactions micro dataset, we assess the roles of local COVID-19 severity, government measures against the spread of the virus, and vaccination rates for householdsâ€™ consumption behavior in Belgium. We find that households living in areas that experienced high COVID-19 positivity rates and more stringent containment measures, decreased their consumption more. The relevance of these effects, however, shifted over the course of the pandemic. Higher local vaccination rates significantly counteracted these negative impacts on household consumption. Furthermore, our study highlights that the impact of these factors on consumption varied distinctly across households with different income, liquid wealth, and age characteristics.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper uses detailed bank transaction data to examine how COVID-19 affected household consumption patterns, revealing significant heterogeneity across demographic groups.

<!-- This research provides novel insights into the heterogeneous economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic using granular household-level transaction data. The findings have important implications for understanding crisis responses and designing targeted policy interventions.

## Key Findings

1. **Heterogeneous Responses**: Consumption impacts varied significantly across demographic groups
2. **Sectoral Differences**: Contact-intensive sectors experienced larger declines
3. **Age Effects**: Younger households showed more pronounced consumption reductions
4. **Policy Implications**: Results inform targeted support measure design

## Data and Methodology

The analysis leverages a unique dataset from a major Belgian bank covering:
- Over 200,000 households
- Detailed transaction-level data
- Full pandemic period coverage
- Granular spending category information
