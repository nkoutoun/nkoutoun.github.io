abstract: This paper examines the stability of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) using panel data from the Johannesburg Securities Exchange. We investigate whether the 2008 financial crisis affected the validity of CAPM predictions by comparing pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. Using a comprehensive dataset of South African equities, we employ panel regression techniques to test the stability of beta coefficients and the risk-return relationship. Our findings suggest significant structural breaks in the CAPM relationship around the financial crisis period, with implications for portfolio management and asset pricing in emerging markets.

This research investigates the stability of one of the most fundamental models in finance—the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)—in the context of the 2008 global financial crisis. Using data from the Johannesburg Securities Exchange, we provide evidence on how major financial disruptions affect core asset pricing relationships.

## Key Contributions

1. **Crisis Impact Assessment**: First comprehensive study of CAPM stability around the 2008 crisis for South African markets
2. **Panel Data Approach**: Employs robust panel regression techniques to test model stability
3. **Emerging Market Focus**: Provides insights specific to emerging market dynamics
4. **Structural Break Analysis**: Identifies significant changes in risk-return relationships

## Methodology

- **Data**: Comprehensive dataset from Johannesburg Securities Exchange
- **Period**: Pre-crisis (2005-2007) and post-crisis (2009-2011) comparison
- **Method**: Panel regression with structural break tests
- **Sample**: Broad cross-section of South African equities

## Findings

The analysis reveals significant structural breaks in the CAPM relationship, suggesting that the financial crisis fundamentally altered risk-return dynamics in the South African market. These findings have important implications for:

- Portfolio management strategies
- Risk assessment methodologies  
- Asset pricing in emerging markets
- Financial regulation and oversight
