abstract: This paper examines behavioral responses to Belgium's tax on securities accounts, which targets high-wealth individuals. Using detailed administrative data, we analyze how wealthy households adjust their portfolios, asset holdings, and financial strategies in response to this wealth tax policy. Our findings provide new evidence on the effectiveness and unintended consequences of wealth taxation.

This research provides novel evidence on how high-wealth individuals respond to wealth taxation, using Belgium's tax on securities accounts as a natural experiment. The analysis leverages detailed administrative data to track behavioral changes and portfolio adjustments.

## Research Context

Belgium's tax on securities accounts provides an ideal setting to study wealth tax responses:

1. **Clean Policy Experiment**: Clear threshold-based tax design
2. **High-Quality Data**: Administrative records with detailed portfolio information  
3. **Recent Implementation**: Contemporary policy relevance
4. **Cross-Border Considerations**: International wealth management implications

## Key Research Questions

- **Portfolio Responses**: How do wealthy individuals adjust their asset allocations?
- **Avoidance Strategies**: What mechanisms are used to minimize tax liability?
- **Revenue Effects**: How effective is the tax at generating government revenue?
- **Distributional Impact**: Who bears the ultimate burden of the wealth tax?

## Methodology

- **Data**: Administrative tax records and financial account data
- **Design**: Regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences approaches
- **Sample**: High-wealth individuals subject to the securities account tax
- **Period**: Pre- and post-implementation comparison

## Policy Relevance

The findings contribute to ongoing debates about:
- Optimal wealth tax design
- International tax coordination
- Revenue potential of wealth taxation
- Unintended behavioral consequences
