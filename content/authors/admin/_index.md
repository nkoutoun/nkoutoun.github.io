## About Me

I'm a final-year PhD candidate on the 2025–26 academic job market. My research maps aggregate shocks into household decisions and regional outcomes with credible identification, guided by a micro-to-macro approach that combines large-scale administrative data and causal inference. My job-market paper reveals a stark split in how U.S. households restructure debt after income windfalls. A defining feature of my doctoral work has been proactively securing innovative data by establishing partnerships with industry providers. I strive to publish open, reproducible tools to support my research.
