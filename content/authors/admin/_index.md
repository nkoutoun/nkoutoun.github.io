## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Ghent University, focusing on Empirical Macroeconomics, Monetary Economics & Policy, Oil Markets, Macro-Finance, and Inequality. I also serve as an Economist in Residence at BNP Paribas Fortis, where I contribute to the 'Analytics & Artificial Intelligence' unit constructing "Models for a Changing world."

My research has been presented at various conferences including the 49th Annual Eastern Economic Association Conference and the 12th Biennial Conference of the Czech Economic Society. I have published in the African Review of Economics and Finance and have several working papers on topics such as the heterogeneous impact of COVID-19 on consumption and the effects of global oil price shocks on the US economy.

Previously, I worked at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt am Main, first as a trainee in Money Markets and Liquidity and later as a Risk Analyst in the Risk Strategy Division. I hold an M.Sc. in Economics and Business from Erasmus University Rotterdam and a Bachelor's in Economics from the University of Macedonia in Greece.
