## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Ghent University (expected 2026), focusing on Empirical Macroeconomics, Household Economics and Finance, and Energy Economics. My research has been published in the Journal of Macroeconomics and the African Review of Economics and Finance. My job market paper explores "The heterogeneous reactions of household credit to income shocks." I have been a Visiting Scholar at Harvard University's Opportunity Insights Data Lab (hosted by Raj Chetty) and the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business (hosted by Daniel Murphy). Previously, I worked at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt am Main, first as a trainee in Money Markets and Liquidity and later as a Risk Analyst in the Risk Strategy Division. I hold an M.Sc. in Economics and Business from Erasmus University Rotterdam and a Bachelor's in Economics from the University of Macedonia in Greece.
